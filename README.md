Technical Implementation Notes:

- No CSS or JavaScript was used, as required.
- All internal navigation uses relative paths.
- The `<img>` elements include `alt` text for accessibility.
- The website structure is clean, organized, and scalable.
- Each HTML file uses proper boilerplate structure with `<head>` and `<body>` tags.

---

Validation:

All pages have been tested in a browser and display correctly.  
Relative links and images load successfully.  
The site structure and markup follow best practices for static HTML.
